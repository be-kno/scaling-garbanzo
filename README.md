# Restaurant Order Management System

This system is a basic yet functional tool designed for handling orders in a restaurant setting. It allows staff to create new customer orders, view existing orders, update order details as needed, delete orders if necessary, and search through orders based on criteria like order number, customer name, or date. The primary focus is on demonstrating proficiency in CRUD operations within a restaurant context.
